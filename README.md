I have recently 2022 worked on several microservice projects for which I setup a framework (ongoing) that i use regularly.
It consists of two parts, the ARM Templates for azure for creating the environment and a Shared Library that you will adjust and build into local nuget feed packages for use in your other .NET Projects of your system.

  *  To get the ARM Templates: https://github.com/sandromastronardi/ARM_Cloud_Infrastructure
  *  To get the .NET Libraries: https://github.com/sandromastronardi/CloudInfra_Shared_Libraries
  
Let me know what you think, do suggestions, ask questions.  I could not find a good base setup for a microservice architecture so I made one myself based on what I learned along the way.

Sandro
